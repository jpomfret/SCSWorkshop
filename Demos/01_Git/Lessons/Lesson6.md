# Lesson 6 - Clean up those branches

## Prerequisites

- Worked through the other lessons and left branches all over the place.

## Lesson

### Stage 1 - View our local branches

1. Checkout main

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

2. View our local branches

    ```bash
    git branch -v
    ```

3. View branches that have been merged into main

    ```bash
    git branch --merged
    ```

4. Delete a single branch

    ```bash
    git branch -d addFriends
    ```

5. Delete all merged branches

    ```bash
    git branch --merged | ?{-not ($_ -like "*main")} | %{git branch -d $_.trim()}
    ```
